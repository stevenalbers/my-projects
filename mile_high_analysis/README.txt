#Mile High Analysis
###About
The NFL Play by Play dataset provided by [Advanced Football Analytics](http://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com/2010/04/play-by-play-data.html) is a wonderfully complete, if slightly unwieldy resource that documents every play by every NFL team over the 2002-2012 seasons. A lot of research goes into debunking certain football myths, and I was curious to see just how much of an effect the Denver Broncos' high-altitude stadium really has on players.

Mile High Stadium is the only football arena that isn't at (or very close to) sea level, and it is widely understood that this has a substantial effect on athletes' ability to compete. I want to know if there is any data that says otherwise.

I will load the data (~75mb) into a database and attempt to create some models using Python's Pandas library based on certain criteria like Quarterback pass attempts and completion percentages at Denver's stadium vs. all others, Kicker accuracy and average distances, etc.
